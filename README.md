# Mastering ASP.NET Web API – Study Notes & Code

This repository contains my detailed notes and code examples as I work through the textbook *Mastering ASP.NET Web API* by Mithun Pattankar and Malendra Hurbuns.

The goal is to deepen my understanding of building robust, RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core.


## Purpose

To showcase my learning process, hands-on skills, and progression in backend API development.

I have been developing a production-grade server using ASP.NET Core Web API with DRCC since September 2023. Through this project, I aim to enhance my understanding of the underlying principles behind designing scalable, maintainable, and secure API architectures.


## Chapters Covered

- **Chapter 1** – Introduction to Microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- **Chapter 2** – Understanding HTTP and REST
- **Chapter 3** – Anatomy of ASP.NET Core Web API

*(More chapters and code will be added as I continue working through the book.)*
